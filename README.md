# CodeQuiz
A timed, multiple choice quiz based on coding related questions. Users will be given 75 seconds to answer 5 questions. A high score is obtained by answering quickly. Any time left on the timer is the user's score. If the user answers incorrectly, 10 seconds will be deducted from any remaining time left.

A final score is presented at the end.

Need support with using local storage to keep track of high scores and appending information to page & coding to restart app.
